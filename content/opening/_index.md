## Overview

We are actively seeking new members at all levels, including Undergraduate, Master, and PhD students. Our research is rooted in Geotechnical Engineering, while many of our projects have focuses on image processing, uncertainty quantification, and remote sensing, by working closely with Geoscientists and Computer Scientists to solve Geo-risk challenges. If none of above makes sense to you but you think you would be a good fit for the group, you can send your request with an explanation of the specific role you are interested in (self-funded visiting scholar, independent study project, etc.).
