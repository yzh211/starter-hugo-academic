Hi, I am Yichuan Zhu of Civil & Environmental Engineering Department at Temple University. I currently lead the Computational Geosystems Group that focuses on a variety of problems, including micro-mechanics of granular material, landslides characterization and mitigation, computational geosciences, and probabilistic machine learning and uncertainty quantification in geotechnical engineering.

Our research is inherently interdisciplinary, bridging the fields of Civil Engineering, Geosciences, and Computer Science. If you are interested in discussing research or joining my group, please send me email or check out our openings page for more information and the description of current openings.
